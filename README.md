# Assembly_language_project
Making a conversion program between binary and decimal using assembly language

**Get the codes from main.asm**

ax -> 16 bits

eax -> 32 bits

esi -> used to store counters

mov -> move (e.g mov edx, offset str1) move str1 into edx

WriteString -> display the string from edx

WriteChar -> display a character 

ReadInt -> read the input integer from user

ReadString -> read the input string from user

cmp -> compare

je -> jump if equal

jne -> jump if not equal

jmp -> just jump 

normally any input from user will assign to ax / eax

sub -> -
add -> +
mul -> x
div -> /
